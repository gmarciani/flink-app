   * <p>The implementor must ensure <tt>sgn(x.compareTo(y)) ==
   * -sgn(y.compareTo(x))</tt> for all <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  (This
   * implies that <tt>x.compareTo(y)</tt> must throw an exception iff

   * <p>
   * <p>The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
   * <tt>(x.compareTo(y)&gt;0 &amp;&amp; y.compareTo(z)&gt;0)</tt> implies
   * <tt>x.compareTo(z)&gt;0</tt>.
   * <p>

   * class that implements the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface and violates
   * this condition should clearly indicate this fact.  The recommended
   * language is "Note: this class has a natural ordering that is
   * inconsistent with equals."
   * <p>
   * <p>In the foregoing description, the notation
   * <tt>sgn(</tt><i>expression</i><tt>)</tt> designates the mathematical
   * <i>signum</i> function, which is defined to return one of <tt>-1</tt>,
   * <tt>0</tt>, or <tt>1</tt> according to whether the value of
   * <i>expression</i> is negative, zero or positive.
